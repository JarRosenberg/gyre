Stellar Model Files
*******************

GYRE supports a number of different formats for stellar model files:

AMDL
  Binary file describing an evolutionary model in AASTEC format

FAMDL
  Text file describing an evolutionary model in FAMDL format

FGONG
  Text file describing an evolutionary model in FGONG format

GSM
  HDF5 file describing an evolutionary model in GYRE Stellar Model (GSM) format

MESA
  Text file describing an evolutionary model in MESA format (as
  generated by `MESA <mesa_>`__ when the :nml_v:`pulse_info_format` parameter is
  set to 'GYRE')
  
B3
  HDF5 file describing an evolutionary model in B3 format. This format
  is for testing purposes only, and will eventually be superseded and/or
  removed

LOSC
  text file describing an evolutionary model in the revised LOSC format

OSC
  text file describing an evolutionary model in OSC format

POLY
  HDF5 file describing a polytrope in POLY format 

Cubic spline interpolation is used to evaluate data between model grid
points. The :nml_o:`deriv_type` parameter in the :nml_g:`model`
namelist group controls how the spline derivatives are set up.
