Quick Start
***********

To get started with GYRE, follow these five steps:

1. Install the `MESA Software Development Kit <mesa-sdk_>`__
2. Download the `GYRE source code <github-tarball_>`__
3. Unpack the source code using the :command:`tar` utility
4. Set the :envvar:`GYRE_DIR` environment variable to point to the
   newly created source directory
5. Compile GYRE using the command :command:`make -C $GYRE_DIR`

For a more in-depth installation guide that covers alternative
use-cases, refer to the :ref:`installation` chapter. If the code
doesn't compile properly, consult the :ref:`troubleshooting`
chapter. Otherwise, proceed to the next chapter where you'll put
together your first GYRE calculation.
