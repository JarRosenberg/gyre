Intended Audience
=================

This manual is aimed at a broad audience --- whether you're a GYRE
novice or a seasoned veteran, it provides you with the information
you'll need to get the most out of GYRE. However, it does presume some
experience with Unix command-line environments, and likewise some
basic familiarity with the subject of stellar oscillations. If you
need the former, then the Internet is your oyster; and for the latter,
we recommend the following online resources:

* JÃ¸rgen Christensen-Dalsgaard's `Lecture Notes on Stellar Oscillations <https://users-phys.au.dk/jcd/oscilnotes/Lecture_Notes_on_Stellar_Oscillations.pdf>`__;
* Gerald Handler's `Asteroseismology <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.6407.pdf>`__ article.

Citing GYRE
===========

If you use GYRE in your research, please cite the relevant
'instrument' papers:

* :ads_citet:`townsend:2013` describes the basic operation of the code;
* :ads_citet:`townsend:2018` outlines improvements to allow non-adiabatic calculations.
* Goldstein & Townsend (2020, in press) describes the contour method for non-adiabatic calculations.

If you find yourself using GYRE on a regular basis, you might consider
contributing to the project to ensure its long-term success. Options include

* contributing code to the project (e.g., via GitHub pull requests), to
  extend GYRE's capabilities;
* contributing documentation and tutorials to the project, to make GYRE more user-friendly;
* inviting the GYRE team to be co-authors on relevant papers;
* inviting the GYRE team to be co-investigators on relevant grant applications.
