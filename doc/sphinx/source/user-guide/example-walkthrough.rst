Example Walkthrough
*******************

This chapter provides a walkthrough of a example GYRE project, to
illustrate the typical steps involved. For this example, we'll be
focusing on finding eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of quadrupole
(:math:`\ell=2`) gravity modes for a slowly pulsating B (SPB) stellar
model.

Making a Place to Work
======================

When starting a new project, it's a good idea to create a dedicated
working directory to contain the various input and output files that
GYRE operates on. These commands will make a new directory beneath
your home directory with the name ``work``, and then change into it:

.. substitution-prompt:: bash

   mkdir ~/work
   cd ~/work

Grabbing a Stellar Model
========================

The next step is to grab a stellar model for GYRE to work with. There
are a number of models provided beneath the ``$GYRE_DIR/models``
directory; the following commands will copy a MESA model for a
:math:`5\,\Msun` SPB star into your working directory:

.. substitution-prompt:: bash

   cp $GYRE_DIR/models/mesa/spb/spb.mesa .

Creating a Namelist File
========================

Now comes the fun part: creating an input file containing the various
parameters which control a GYRE run. Using a text editor, create the
file ``gyre.in`` in your working directory with the following
contents cut-and-pasted in:

.. literalinclude:: example-walkthrough/gyre.in

This file is an example of a Fortran ''namelist'' file, containing
multiple namelist groups. Each group begins with the line
:nml_g:`name` (where ``name`` is the name of the group); a list of
name-value pairs follows, and the group ends with a slash
``/``. Detailed information on the namelist groups expected in GYRE's
input files can be found in the :ref:`namelist-input-files` chapter;
for now, let's just focus on some of the more-important aspects of the
file above:

* The :nml_g:`constants` namelist group is used to override constants
  such as the gravitational constant; here it's empty, indicating that
  default values should be used
* The :nml_g:`model` namelist group instructs GYRE to read an
  evolutionary model, in :repo:`MESA format <doc/mesa-format.pdf>`,
  from the file ``spb.mesa``
* The :nml_g:`mode` namelist group instructs GYRE to consider
  quadrupole (:math:`\ell=2`) modes
* The :nml_g:`osc` namelist group instructs GYRE to apply a
  zero-pressure outer mechanical boundary condition in the oscillation
  equations
* The :nml_g:`scan` namelist group instructs GYRE to scan a region of
  dimensionless angular frequency space typically occupied by gravity
  modes
* The :nml_g:`grid` namelist group instructs GYRE to perform
  calculations on a refinement of the model grid (see [[Understanding
  Grids]] for details on how this works)
* The :nml_g:`ad_output` namelist group instructs GYRE to write out
  summary data to the file ``summary.txt``, and individual mode data
  to files having the prefix ``mode.``
* The :nml_g:`nad_output` namelist group is empty, telling GYRE not to
  write out any non-adiabatic data (see
  :ref:`non-adiabatic-calculations` for more info)

Running GYRE
============

With the hard work done, it's now trivial to run GYRE:

.. substitution-prompt:: bash
			 
   $GYRE_DIR/bin/gyre gyre.in

As the code runs (on multiple cores, if you have a multi-core machine;
see :ref:`faq-multicore` for more details), it will print lots of data
to the screen. Let's break down this output, chunk by chunk.

First, GYRE prints out its version number, tells us (in OpenMP
threads) how many cores it is running on, and indicates which file it
is reading parameters from (here, ``gyre.in``):

.. literalinclude:: example-walkthrough/gyre.out
   :language: console
   :end-before: Model Init

Next, GYRE loads the stellar model from the file ``spb.mesa``. This
model comprises 1814 points and extends from the surface all the way
to the center (which is why GYRE decides not to add a central point).

.. literalinclude:: example-walkthrough/gyre.out
   :language: console
   :start-after: Input filename
   :end-before: Mode Search

GYRE then prepares to searching for modes with harmonic degree
:math:`\ell=2` and azimuthal order :math:`m=0` (not specified in
``gyre.in``, but assumed by default), by building a frequency scan and
a spatial (:math:`x`) grid:

.. literalinclude:: example-walkthrough/gyre.out
   :language: console
   :start-after: No need
   :end-before: Starting search

(The concepts of frequency scans and spatial grids are explored in
greater detail in the :ref:`gyre-fundamentals` chapter). Next, GYRE
attempts to bracket roots of the discriminant function (again, see
:ref:`gyre-fundamentals`) by searching for changes in its sign:

.. literalinclude:: example-walkthrough/gyre.out
   :language: console
   :start-after: Segment 1
   :end-before: Root Solving

Finally, for each sign change found GYRE uses a root solver to
converge to the eigenfrequency. Each row of output here corresponds to
a mode that GYRE has successfully found:

.. literalinclude:: example-walkthrough/gyre.out
   :language: console
   :start-after: Time elapsed

The columns appearing are as follows:

``l``
  harmonic degree :math:`\ell`

``m``
  azimuthal order :math:`m`
  
``n_pg``
  radial order :math:`n` (in the Eckart-Osaki-Scuflaire-Takata scheme)

``n_p``
  acoustic-wave winding number :math:`n_{\rm p}`

``n_g``
  gravity-wave winding number :math:`n_{\rm g}`

``Re(omega)``
  real part of dimensionless eigenfrequency :math:`\omega`

``Im(omega)``
  imaginary part of dimensionless eigenfrequency :math:`\omega` (zero
  here because we've performed an adiabatic calculation)

``chi``
  convergence parameter

``n_iter``
  number of iterations required for convergence

These values are printed to screen primarily to give an idea of GYRE's
progress; more-detailed information about the modes found is given in
the output files discussed below. Some things to watch out for:

* The convergence parameter ``chi``, defined as the ratio of
  discriminant values before and after the root finding, should small
  (on the order of 1E-9 to 1E-13). If it is significantly larger than
  this, the mode may not be properly converged; and if it is
  significantly smaller than this, there may be numerical issues with
  the discretization scheme.

* The number of iterations ``n_iter`` should be moderate; values above
  20 or so indicate that GYRE is having problems converging.

* The mode index ``n_pg`` should be monotonic-increasing. Departures
  from this behavior can happen for a number of reasons:

  * Missing values can indicate that GYRE has skipped a mode in
    frequency space; the fix is to use a finer frequency scan.

  * Missing values together with duplicate and/or non-monotonic values
    can indicate that GYRE isn't resolving the spatial structure of
    eigenfunctions; the fix is to use a finer spatial grid.

  * Missing values together with duplicate and/or non-monotonic values
    can *also* incdicate problems with the input stellar model ---
    for instance, incorrect values for the Brunt-Vaisala frequency
    across density discontinuities; the fix is to stop expecting GYRE
    to give sensible output when fed crap stellar models!

Interpreting Output Files
=========================

Overall properties of all modes found (eigenfrequencies, inertias,
etc.) are collected together in the file ``summary.txt``. For each
mode GYRE also writes a file with the name ``mode.NNNNN.txt``,
containing data (eigenfrequency, eigenfunctions, etc.) specific to the
mode. Here, ``NNNNN`` denotes a 5-digit index which increments
(starting at ``00001``) for each mode found. Note that this index
bears no relation to the radial order ``n_pg``; it merely serves as a
unique label for the modes.

Both the sumamry file and the mode files are text-based (it's possible
to write HDF5-format files instead; see the :ref:`output-files`
chapter for details). The command

.. substitution-prompt:: bash

   head summary.txt

will print out the first 10 lines of the summary file, which should
look something like this:

.. literalinclude:: example-walkthrough/summary.txt
   :language: console
   :lines: 1-10

The first three lines give column numbers, labels, and values for the
scalar data â€” here, the stellar mass ``M_star`` and radius ``R_star``,
expressed in cgs units. The next two lines give column numbers and
labels for the per-mode data (``E_norm`` is the normalized mode
inertia, and the other columns are the same as described above for the
screen output); the subsequent lines then give the corresponding
values (one line per mode). The mode files have a similar layout, with
scalar data followed by array data representing the eigenfunctions
(one line per radial grid point).

The choice of which data appear in output files isn't hardwired, but
rather determined by the :nml_n:`summary_item_list` and
:nml_n:`mode_item_list` parameters of the :nml_g:`ad_output` and
:nml_g:`nad_output` namelist groups. Changing these parameters allows
you to tailor the files to contain exactly the data you need. For a
full list of possible items, consult the :ref:`output-files` chapter.
