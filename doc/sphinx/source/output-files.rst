Output Files
************

The output files produced by GYRE fall into two categories. *Summary
files* gather together information about all modes found during a GYRE
run -- for instance, eigenfrequencies, radial orders, etc. *Mode
files*, by contrast, gather together information about a single mode
-- for instance, eigenfunctions, rotation kernel, etc. For both
categories, the file format on disk can be either text-based or
HDF-based.
