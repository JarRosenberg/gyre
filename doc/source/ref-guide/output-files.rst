Output Files
************

The output files written by GYRE fall into two categories. *Summary
files* gather together information about all modes found during a GYRE
run -- for instance, eigenfrequencies, radial orders, etc. *Detail
files*, by contrast, gather together information about a single mode
-- for instance, eigenfunctions, differential inertias, etc. For both
categories, the file can be written in either HDF (HDF5-based) or TXT
(TXT-based) format.
