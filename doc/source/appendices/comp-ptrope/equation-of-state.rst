Equation of State
=================

A composite polytrope comprises :math:`\nreg` regions extending from
the origin out to the stellar surface. In the :math:`i`'th region
(:math:`1 \leq i \leq \nreg`), the density and pressure are related by the
polytropic equation of state

.. math::

   P_{i} = K_{i} \rho_{i}^{(n_{i} + 1)/n_{i}}

where :math:`K_{i}` and the polytropic index :math:`n_{i}` are
constant across the region (but may differ from one region
to the next). At the :math:`\nreg-1` boundaries between adjacent
regions, the pressure is required to be continuous but the
density may jump.
