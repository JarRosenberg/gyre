Tidal Forcing
=============

This section discusses how to evaluate stellar response(s) to tidal
forcing using the :program:`gyre_tides` frontend. These data can be
used to synthesize a light curve for a tidally distorted star; they
can also allow the secular rates-of-change of orbital elements to be
calculated.

.. note::
   Not all types of stellar mode include the necessary data
   (e.g., thermodynamic coefficients, opacity partial derivatives) to
   undertake non-adiabatic calculations. The :ref:`model-caps` section
   summarizes this information.
