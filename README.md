# GYRE

GYRE is a stellar oscillation code. Given an input stellar model, GYRE
calculates the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions for the normal
oscillation modes of the model. These data can be put to a variety of
uses; the most common is to compare them against observed oscillation
frequencies of a star, allowing constraints on the star’s fundamental
parameters (mass, radius, etc.) to be established — the discipline of
*asteroseismology*.
